# Deep learning models for peak detection in chromatograms

## Requirements
* Python ~= 3.8
* Pip ~= 20.0.2
* Python packages; run from terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It will install necessary python packages (e.g., Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow (2.4), etc.)

## Train the CNN model
Navigate to notebooks and run from terminal: `jupyter notebook`. Open `01_cnn-train.ipynb` and run it.

## Perform peak detection with the CNN model
Navigate to notebooks and run from terminal: `jupyter notebook`. Open `02_cnn-predict.ipynb` and run it.
